- 👋 Hi, I’m Austin Hinkel.  I teach Physics and Astronomy at Colorado College. 
- 👀 I’m interested in Astrophysics and applying data science for social good. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to github. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any project which (1) involves astrophysical probes of dark matter via galactic structure or (2) helps to meet a United Nations Sustainable Development Goal, broadly construed, including working on climate action, health equity, etc.  I am particularly interested in applying data science towards these goals. 
- 📫 How to reach me: I currently work at Colorado College in Colorado Springs, CO.  You can find my institutional email address on the Colorado College website.
