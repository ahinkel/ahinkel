- 👋 Hi, I’m Austin Hinkel.  I teach Physics and Astronomy at Thomas More University.
- 👀 I’m interested in Astrophysics and applying data science for social good. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning more about machine learning and neural networks. 
- 💼 I'm currently working on new probes of Galactic structure, with an interest in understanding more about dark matter and the history of the Milky Way Galaxy. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any project which (1) involves astrophysical probes of dark matter via Galactic structure or (2) helps to meet a United Nations Sustainable Development Goal, broadly construed, including working on climate action, health equity, etc.  I am particularly interested in applying data science towards these goals. 
- 📫 How to reach me: I currently work at Thomas More University in Crestview Hills, KY.  You can reach me at my institutional email address, which is (my lastname)(my first name initial)(at)(thomasmore.edu).
